## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass (CSS Extension Language)
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

- Working with the [Advice Slip JSON API](https://api.adviceslip.com){:target="_blank"}
- How to use **fetch()** to interact with an **API**
- How to use **async/await**
- How to use **try/catch** when interacting with an API
- How to access object properties
- How to manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript
- How to create a glowing effect around a button

### Continued development

- This was not my first project interacting with an API, but I would still like to work on more projects of varying complexity, for a better understanding of how APIs work.
